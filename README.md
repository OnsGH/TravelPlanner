# Project Instructions



The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls



## Getting started

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

## Setting up the API

### Step 1: Signup for an API key
First, you will need to go  Signing up will get you an API key.
- GeoNames
https://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html

Example : http://api.geonames.org/citiesJSON?north=44.1&south=-9.9&east=-22.4&west=55.2&lang=de&username=demo

- Weatherbit API
https://www.weatherbit.io/account/dashboard

API Documentation https://www.weatherbit.io/api

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Next we need to create .env file and enter your own API credentials:

- GEONAMES_USERNAME = 
- WEATHERBIT_API_KEY = 
- PIXABAY_API_KEY =


### Step 3 : Using the API

We're ready to go! The API has a lot of different endpoints 
- Parse the response body to dynamically fill content on the page.
- Test that the server and form submission work, making sure to also handle error responses if the user input does not match API requirements.â€¨
- Go back to the web pack config and add the setup for service workers. 
- Test that the site is now available even when you stop your local server
## Running the Application
- npm run build-prod
  -  npm start
- npm run test (For the test)

## Chosen Suggestions to Make My Project Stand Out
- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
- Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
